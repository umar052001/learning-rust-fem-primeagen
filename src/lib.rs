//! # Rust Learning Library
//!
//! This library contains various modules, each demonstrating a different
//! concept in the Rust programming language. The goal is to provide a
//! structured way to learn and revise Rust features.

// By declaring the modules here with `pub`, we make them available
// to any binary (like main.rs) that uses this library.
pub mod collections;
pub mod enums;
